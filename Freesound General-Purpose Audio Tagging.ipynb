    "The train set is meant to be for system development and includes **~9.5k samples unequally distributed among 41 categories**. The **minimum number of audio samples per category in the train set is 94, and the maximum 300**. The duration of the audio **samples ranges from 300ms to 30s** due to the diversity of the sound categories and the preferences of Freesound users when recording sounds.\n",

    "The train set is composed of **~3.7k manually-verified annotations and ~5.8k non-verified annotations**. **The quality of the non-verified annotations has been roughly estimated to be at least 65-70% in each sound category**. A flag for each annotation is provided which indicates whether or not that annotation has been manually verified. Participants can use this information during the development of their systems"
