Hi all,



Please fill in this (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QSL9YEwDpYyF_7fcQt1jAjotC2PZma67ta-yYCghu6o/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet with the names of the team members, draft project title, project description (a brief (4 lines max) description) and dataset description (the link to the dataset/dataset size). In addition to this, you may add a link to a google document (shared with me and TA) containing additional details like project timeline, architecture ideas and other details you deem necessary. 

  

Please fill this in by Thursday Noon. If you intend to do the Kaggle (http://dcase.community/challenge2018/task-general-purpose-audio-tagging) project, then just indicate that on the sheet as well, and you can still link to a google document.
