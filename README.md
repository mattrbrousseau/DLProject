# DLProject

Data was not uploaded to GitHub and some tweaking to directories in notebook files may need to be done in order to run notebook. Data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/data

Also please note that I noticed some issues with Github not properly tracking my pushes/commits etc and that it does not reflect all of the work I have done, please use the worklog as the guideline for this stuff. - Kenny
